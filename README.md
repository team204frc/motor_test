### Basic robot code that drives one Spark Max with a joystick.
---

view the "Robot.java" branch to see the entire robot code in one file.  
remain on the "master" branch to see the robot code properly structured.

---

## objectives for new robotics programmers:

- understand the structure of the code, including where certain statements are supposed to reside
- see how robot code is executed (main loop, commands, subsystems)
- read some example functions that we will work with this year
